**Automated Sales Reporting System with Tableau Visualization**

This project demonstrates my commitment to building my skills to automate data processing, generate reports, and create visualizations using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**. 

### **Key Features:**
- **SQL Database Integration**: Queried and processed sales data from a small sample SQLite database.
- **Python Automation**: Cleaned and aggregated data using Python (pandas) and exported it to a CSV file.
- **Tableau Dashboard**: Created an interactive dashboard to visualize sales trends and revenue by product.

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Python**: pandas, sqlite3
- **SQL**: SQLite
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **CSV**: Report generation

### **How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script ('run.py') to generate the sales report.
3. Open the Tableau workbook to explore the interactive dashboard (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rene.carbajal/vizzes)
   - to see the data of the csv generated by you, simply upload the generated csv file into tableau!
